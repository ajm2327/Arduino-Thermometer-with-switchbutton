# Arduino-Thermometer-with-switchbutton
A project including the design of a thermometer using arduino and DHT11 temperature sensor  

This is a class project which involved several requirements which include:  

The thermometer must have a range of -10 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit  

shoudl be accurate to +/- 2 degrees Celsius  

be able to measure normal room temperatures  

be relatively small  

must use a microcontroller (Arduino)  

have some visual display of the temperature  

a minimum of 4 LEDs will be used in the circuit design  

visually display temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius  

utilize a switch in some manner  

the switch must be integrated into the software of the arduino
