# Arduino-Thermometer-with-switchbutton
A project including the design of a thermometer using arduino and DHT11 temperature sensor
This is a class project which involved several requirements which include:
The thermometer must have a range of -10 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit
shoudl be accurate to +/- 2 degrees Celsius
be able to measure normal room temperatures
be relatively small
must use a microcontroller (Arduino)
have some visual display of the temperature
a minimum of 4 LEDs will be used in the circuit design
visually display temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius
utilize a switch in some manner
the switch must be integrated into the software of the arduino
